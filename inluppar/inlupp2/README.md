# Design decisions
* The user interface's current design demonstrates the possible choices that can be done in a simple webstore, wether it's a store manager or a user.
* Current user cannot create or remove a shopping cart on their own. This is done automatically when the first item is being added to a shopping cart and at check out. 
* Valid inputs are being tested in UI, hence there are no tests for valid inputs in business_logic.c
* Errors are handled by user messages and TEXT_ALERT
* Functions use in this program are part from Viktor Hultstens utils.h and Patricia MÃ¼llers hash_table.h & linked_list.h
